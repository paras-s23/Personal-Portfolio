Built a complete PyTorch pipeline on Google Colab to classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal, ensuring reproducible and scalable experiments. Leveraged transfer learning with DenseNet-121 and applied extensive preprocessing and data augmentation for robust model training and evaluation. Optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning, learning rate scheduling, and regularization, and interpreted results using confusion matrices and Grad-CAM visualizations.
