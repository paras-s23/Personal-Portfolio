Implemented patch embedding by dividing images into fixed-size patches, projecting them into a learnable embedding space, and using PyTorch layers with dropout to reduce overfitting. Built a Transformer encoder with multi-head self-attention and MLP blocks, incorporating residual connections and LayerNorm to capture spatial relationships and long-range dependencies. Developed a full training pipeline on Google Colab with preprocessing, augmentation, and checkpointing, and evaluated model performance through self-attention visualization and benchmarking against CNN baselines for accuracy and efficiency.
