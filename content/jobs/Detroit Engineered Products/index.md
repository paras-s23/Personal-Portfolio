-Developed a PointNet++ neural network for semantic segmentation of 3D CAD point clouds of an engine block, focusing on features such as bolts, ribs, and bosses

-Preprocessed massive point cloud files using normalization, farthest-point/importance sampling, and tiling to meet model input requirements and improve learning effectiveness

-Optimized training through augmentation, loss re-weighting, and learning-rate scheduling while managing GPU memory and batch sizing to fit hardware constraints

-Interpreted predictions with 3D visualization tools to evaluate results, identify failure modes, and guide iterative model refinement
